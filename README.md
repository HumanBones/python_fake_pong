# python_fake_pong

This project was made to pratice my Pygame skills, also an introduction to simple Python data processing.


## Setup

Use requirements.txt with pipenv to install the requirements for this projects.
```
pipenv install
```
or
```
pipenv instal shell
```

 I used Python 3.9, if pipenv doesn't work, try just using pip3 to install all the requirements.
```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
