# python_fake_pong

This project was made to pratice my Pygame skills, also an introduction to simple Python data processing. The pong can play itself, using data simple data processing, if you want to play the game yourself, just comment **main_player.Ai_update(should_move)**, and uncomment **main_player.update(vx,vy)**.

## Setup

Use pipenv to install the requirements for this projects.
```
pipenv install
```
or
```
pipenv shell
```

 I used Python 3.9, if pipenv doesn't work, try just using pip3 to install all the requirements.
```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
